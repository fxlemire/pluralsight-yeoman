Pluralsight React Webpack
=========================
This repo is the product of following [Steve Michelotti](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/steve-michelotti)'s class:[Yeoman Fundamentals](http://app.pluralsight.com/courses/yeoman-fundamentals).

I went beyond the scope of this class by adding thorough [ESLinting](http://eslint.org/) and git hooks.

Finally, I used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a text editor, so some useful features will also be found in this repo, such as the use of [typings](https://github.com/typings)
that provide useful autocomplete features (IntelliSense) and some launch/task settings.
